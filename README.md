Reset migration

1. Remove the all migrations files within your project

        Go through each of your projects apps migration folder and remove everything inside, except the __init__.py file.

        Or if you are using a unix-like OS you can run the following script (inside your project dir):

        find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete
        find . -path "*/migrations/*.pyc"  -delete

2. Drop the current database, or delete the db.sqlite3 if it is your case.
3. Create the initial migrations and generate the database schema:

        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate

And you are good to go.
